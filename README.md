# Chain Reaction
A version of the mobile game "Chain Reaction" with added functionality. 

Chain reaction is a multiplayer strategy game for 2 to 8 players. The game is played on a grid of cells. The objective of the game is to take over the grid by eliminating the opponents' orbs. Players take turns to place orbs in a cell on the grid. Once a cell has reached critical mass, placing an orb in the cell causes an explosion, spreading orbs to adjacent cells and claiming those cells for the player. A player can only place an orb in an empty cell or in a cell that already has their orbs in it. A player is eliminated once they lose all their orbs.

This version gives the user greater flexibility with changing the settings of the game. The game allows players to change their:
- Player name with a maximum character limit of 16 characters
- Player color through a custom dialog box

The game also allows players to adjust general settings such as explosion speed and allows users to toggle dark mode.
