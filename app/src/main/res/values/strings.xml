    <string name="howToPlayText">Chain reaction is a multiplayer strategy game for 2 to 8 players. The game is played on a grid of cells. The objective of the game is to take over the grid by eliminating the opponents\' orbs. Players take turns to place orbs in a cell on the grid. Once a cell has reached critical mass, placing an orb in the cell causes an explosion, spreading orbs to adjacent cells and claiming those cells for the player.  A player can only place an orb in an empty cell or in a cell that already has their orbs in it. A player is eliminated once they lose all their orbs.</string>
